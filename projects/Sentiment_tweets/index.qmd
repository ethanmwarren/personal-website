## Introduction

In recent years, the intersection of mental health and athletic performance has garnered significant attention, particularly within the context of high-profile athletes. Recent discussions are challenging existing stigmas and promoting a new culture of openness and support. This study focuses on analyzing public sentiment towards the mental health of athletes by examining tweets posted about Simone Biles after [dropping out of the Olympic Competition in Tokyo](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/sports/olympics/simone-biles-out.html), following mental health concerns.

Simone Biles' public discourse provides a rich playground for exploring societal attitudes towards mental health in the sports domain, using twitter as proxy for public response. Utilizing natural language processing techniques (NLP), this report examines the nuances of public opinion, shedding light on prevalent themes and sentiments expressed on social media. Understanding these perspectives is crucial for addressing stigma and promoting mental health awareness among athletes. This study aims to contribute to the broader conversation on mental health in sports, offering insights into the public's response to athletes' mental health challenges.

#### Project Overview

The primary objective is to understand how public discourse, as seen in Twitter social media, frames mental health issues within the realm of professional international sports. We use sentiment analysis to capture the attitude of the public's reaction. We then use topic modelling to identify common themes present in the tweets, and finally word vectorization to map topics to words and emotions.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The dataset was compiled from public tweets using the Twitter API, isolating tweets mentioning gymnastics during the 2020 Summer Olympics. The collection period spanned from July 15 to August 14, 2021, capturing the timeline of Simone Biles's participation and subsequent withdrawal. The dataset contains around 16.5K tweets. The features present in this dataset include: the textual content of each tweet, any entities present (hashtags, mentions, urls, etc.), the time posted, and the unique twitter ID of both the author and the tweet. 

Notably, any information related to engagement metrics, i.e. likes, comments, replies, and retweets, is not part of the dataset. This required us to direct our analytical focus towards natural language processing due to the data’s qualitative nature.

**The cleaned data consisted of the following fields:**

<table style="border: 1px solid black; width: 70%; margin-left: 40px; text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse;">
  <tr>
    <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;">Variable</th>

### Exploratory Data Analysis

We began our analysis by exploring the dataset to understand the dataset on a broad level before diving into an analysis. We began by creating a word cloud of the tweet textual data. 

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="wordcloud.png" alt="Word Cloud" width="500">
  <figcaption>Fig 1. Word Cloud</figcaption>
</figure>

Olympics, gymnastics, and Simone Biles are all central to this word cloud, indicating a high volume of tweets that contained these words. Other recurrent terms such as "tokyo2020," "team," "gold," and "sport" further characterize the dataset’s focus around gymnastics and the Olympic Competition.

We then looked at the number of tweets per hour and how they evolved over time after Simone Biles made the announcement to drop out of the Olympics. The team used an eight-hour rolling mean to smooth out the curve over a longer time period while still retaining the shape of the data. 

<figure style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: center;">
  <img src="tweetvolume.png" alt="Graph showing the number of tweets over time, with a spike when Biles announces her drop out." width="600">
  <figcaption>Fig 2. Tweet volume per 8 hours.</figcaption>
</figure>

We see a clear spike right after her announcement, indicating a public response on the day she decided to drop out; however, we also see the number of tweets decrease relatively quickly after August 27, returning to what seems to be normal olympic tweet volume after about a week, and then to low tweet activity after just 2 weeks. This suggests there was not a sustained public reaction.

Finally, we looked at the top 10 most common hashtags present.

<figure style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: center;">
  <img src="hashtags.png" alt="Bar chart showing top 10 hashtags." width="700">
  <figcaption>Fig 3. Bar Chart of Hashtags.</figcaption>
</figure>

We can see again an strong focus on gymnastics, with the olympics, and Simone Biles also being important hashtags. We see the first mention of mental health in the 9th most common hashtag, indicating that it is a relevant topic to this dataset, but appears not to be the primary focus of the tweets. With a better understanding of the content of the data, we move on to natural language processing.

### Natural Language Processing

#### Preprocessing

To prepare for NLP, we further preprocessed the tweet data to standardize it, focusing on the pure textual content. We followed preprocessing protocol by first removing all punctuation and special characters, as well as any stop words like "the," "is," and "and" which don't carry meaningful information. Tweets were then lemmatized, breaking down words to their root form (e.g. 'flipping' $\rightarrow$ 'flip'), which typically improves NLP results. We did our best to remove junk tweets, and decided to remove all links and url patterns from the text as well, to focus on the textual content of each tweet.

#### Sentiment Analysis

For sentiment analysis, we employed the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) tool, which is well-suited for social media text due to its consideration of contextual polarity and intensity. VADER assigns each tweet a sentiment score based on a predefined lexicon. The sentiment score ranges from -1 to 1, where:

- **Negative sentiment**: Scores closer to -1 indicate negative sentiment.
- **Neutral sentiment**: Scores around 0 indicate neutral sentiment.
- **Positive sentiment**: Scores closer to 1 indicate positive sentiment.

Each tweet in the dataset was processed through the VADER tool to generate sentiment scores. The distribution of sentiment scores across the dataset was analyzed and the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral tweets, was calculated. Further analysis was conducted to compare sentiment scores from tweets that came from before and after Biles' announcement, and isolating tweets that specifically discuss mental health to identify different sentiment patterns.

The sentiment analysis results set the foundation for further investigation into the public's perception of athletes' mental health and provided a contextual basis for the subsequent topic modeling.

#### Non-negative Matrix Factorization

To further understand the themes and discussions within tweets about Simone Biles, we employed topic modeling, a technique designed to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. This study utilized Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), a method that is particularly effective for high-dimensional text data, providing clearer and more interpretable topics. 

While many topic modelling techniques were initially tested, like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), NMF was chosen for its robustness in handling large text datasets and its ability to produce easily interpretable topics. NMF works by factorizing the term-document matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices: a term-topic matrix and a topic-document matrix. Each document (tweet) is represented as a mixture of topics, and each topic is represented as a mixture of terms.

**Implementation:**

- **Library**: The NMF model was implemented using Python's Scikit-learn library.
- **Parameter Selection**: The number of topics was determined by evaluating the coherence scores and conducting manual inspections to ensure meaningful and distinct topics.
- **Process**: The preprocessed tweet data was vectorized using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to create the term-document matrix. This matrix was then decomposed using NMF.

The resulting topics were analyzed and ordered by thematic prominence within the dataset. Each topic was defined by a set of high-weighted words, providing insights into the key themes discussed in relation to Simone Biles' mental health.

To gain further insights into these topics, the top 10 weighted words from each topic were embedded into a vector space using the [word2vec Google News 300](https://huggingface.co/fse/word2vec-google-news-300) word embeddings. These vectors were averaged to generate a single vector per topic, which was then mapped back to the closest word in the embedding space, identifying a single representative word for each topic. Additionally, the emotional sentiment of each topic was inferred using a similar embedding approach, associating each topic with the closest emotion word. 

## Results

#### Sentiment Analysis

The sentiment analysis revealed insightful trends in the public's reaction to Simone Biles' mental health disclosure. A histogram plot of the sentiment scores distribution for all tweets in the dataset indicated that the majority of sentiment scores were close to neutral, with a slight skew towards positive sentiments. This suggests that, overall, the public sentiment towards Simone Biles during this period was more supportive than critical. This surprised the team, as we expected a significant negative sentiment to be present.

<figure style="margin-right: 30px; text-align: center;">
  <img src="Sentiment.png" alt="Histogram showing distribution of tweets' sentiment scores." width="700">
  <figcaption>Fig 4. Histogram distribution of sentiment scores for tweets.</figcaption>
</figure>

Further analysis was conducted to compare sentiment scores before and after Biles' announcement. Histogram plots for each period visually appeared similar, implying no significant change in sentiment of tweets before and after Biles announced her withdrawal. The average sentiment score before her withdrawal was 0.172, and after was 0.174. A t-test confirmed no statistically significant difference between the means, indicating that Biles' announcement did not drastically alter public sentiment.

Another split on the dataset was conducted to examine whether tweets specifically discussing mental health exhibited different sentiment patterns, which was done by isolating tweets containing mental health awareness keywords and hashtags. The sentiment distribution of these tweets, compared to those without such keywords, showed that mental health-related tweets had slightly more extreme positive sentiment scores. The average sentiment for mental health tweets was 0.173, while for non-mental health tweets, it was 0.163. However, a t-test found no significant difference between these means, suggesting that the overall sentiment towards mental health topics in the context of Biles' situation remained consistent with the general sentiment.

#### Topic Modelling

The topic modeling analysis using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) successfully identified several key themes within the tweets. In NMF, topics are ordered by prevalence, and each topic is defined by a set of high-weighted words, as well as its average word and most closely associated emotion. The 5 most prominent topics among this set of tweets are listed below (Fig 6.).

**Topic 1**: This topic clearly encapsulates the general enthusiasm and engagement with the Olympic events. The closest word to this topic vector was "watch," with the associated emotion being "love," indicating a positive and supportive sentiment among the public towards the Olympics.

**Topic 2**: This topic appears to center on discussions of racial and gender-based discrimination. The word "racism" was the closest match to the topic vector, with "hostility" being the closest emotion, reflecting the critical and adversarial nature of these conversations.

**Topic 3**: This topic appears to capture the conversation surrounding Biles and her mental health struggle. The closest word representing this topic was "mental," with "loneliness" as the associated emotion. This suggests a strong emphasis on mental health issues and a sense of isolation or struggle associated with such discussions. 

**Topic 4**: This topic captured expressions of admiration and congratulations, particularly directed at fellow gymnast Suni Lee. The closest word was "congrats," with the emotion "love," indicating a celebratory and supportive sentiment.

The most dominant topic here suggests that a significant portion of the twitter discourse on gymnastics was driven by general excitement and positive engagement with the Olympics and Team USA's performance. This finding indicates that despite the gravity of Biles' announcement, the overarching public attention remained on the broader spectacle of the Games.

The presence of topics like "racism," and "sexism" highlight that discussions around Biles' withdrawal also inevitably intersect with broader societal issues, indicating that public discourse on mental health in athletes is not isolated but intertwined with other dimensions of social justice, underscoring the complexity of public perceptions and the multifaceted nature of the discourse.

The third topic directly relates to mental health, and indicates that while there was substantial discourse focused on Biles' mental health, it was less prevalent than the excitement for the Olympics and other discussions of racism and sexism social issues. The sentiment of "loneliness" associated with this topic also seems to suggest that public discussions on mental health were tinged with a recognition of the isolation and personal struggle involved. This could imply empathy for Biles, as well as an acknowledgment of the broader challenges faced by athletes when they address mental health issues publicly, but overall the conversations captured by this theme seem to be sympathetic towards Biles and her mental health struggles.

## Conclusions

Regarding the initial research statement, which sought to understand the public sentiment towards athletes' mental health, the findings suggest a dual narrative. On one hand, the significant focus on mental health and the empathetic sentiment of "loneliness" indicate that the public is becoming more aware and potentially more supportive of athletes prioritizing their mental well-being. On the other hand, the lesser prominence of this topic compared to others highlights that while there is growing support, mental health is still not the dominant narrative in public discourse surrounding athletes.

Furthermore, the intersection of mental health discussions with broader societal issues such as racism and sexism reveals that public sentiment towards athletes' mental health cannot be viewed in isolation. It is intricately linked with other dimensions of social justice, indicating that the support for mental health is also influenced by the public's stance on these broader issues.

In conclusion, the public sentiment towards athletes' mental health, as observed through the analysis of tweets during the Tokyo Olympics, appears to be empathetic yet secondary to broader themes of Olympic excitement and social justice discussions. The discourse reflects a growing recognition of the importance of mental health but also underscores the need for continued efforts to elevate these conversations to the forefront of public attention. This duality emphasizes the ongoing challenge of destigmatizing mental health issues in the athletic arena and fostering a more supportive environment for athletes addressing these concerns.

#### Limitations and Future Research

While this analysis provides valuable insights into public discourse surrounding Simone Biles' withdrawal from the Tokyo Olympics, several limitations should be acknowledged. One significant limitation is the focus on a single event and specific athlete, which may not capture the full spectrum of public sentiment towards athletes' mental health. Future research should aim to gather and analyze data related to public discourse on mental health in other high-profile athletes. By examining a broader range of incidents where athletes have publicly addressed their mental health, researchers can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of public sentiment.

Additionally, expanding the temporal scope of data collection would be beneficial. By examining events over a longer period, researchers can identify trends and shifts in public discourse, enhancing the understanding of how societal attitudes towards athletes' mental health evolve and what factors influence these changes. Including data from other social media platforms and news sources could also provide a more holistic view of public sentiment, as different platforms may host varied demographics and types of discourse, offering a richer and more nuanced understanding of public opinion.

Future research should also delve deeper into the intersectionality of issues identified in the current study, such as how discussions on mental health intertwine with topics like racism and sexism across different contexts and athlete demographics. Employing more sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques, such as deep learning-based models, could further enhance the accuracy and depth of emotional sentiment extraction from the text, uncovering subtler nuances in the public's emotional reactions. These advanced methods would contribute to a more detailed and precise understanding of public sentiment towards athletes' mental health.
