Recent discussions are challenging existing stigmas and promoting a new culture of openness and support. This study focuses on analyzing public sentiment towards the mental health of athletes by examining tweets posted about Simone Biles after [dropping out of the Olympic Competition in Tokyo](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/sports/olympics/simone-biles-out.html), following mental health concerns.\n\nSimone Biles' public discourse provides a rich playground for exploring societal attitudes towards mental health in the sports domain, using twitter as proxy for public response. Utilizing natural language processing techniques (NLP), this report examines the nuances of public opinion, shedding light on prevalent themes and sentiments expressed on social media. Understanding these perspectives is crucial for addressing stigma and promoting mental health awareness among athletes. This study aims to contribute to the broader conversation on mental health in sports, offering insights into the public's response to athletes' mental health challenges.

We use sentiment analysis to capture the attitude of the public's reaction. We then use topic modelling to identify common themes present in the tweets, and finally word vectorization to map topics to words and emotions.\n\n## Methodology\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe dataset was compiled from public tweets using the Twitter API, isolating tweets mentioning gymnastics during the 2020 Summer Olympics. The collection period spanned from July 15 to August 14, 2021, capturing the timeline of Simone Biles's participation and subsequent withdrawal. The dataset contains around 16.5K tweets. The features present in this dataset include: the textual content of each tweet, any entities present (hashtags, mentions, urls, etc.), the time posted, and the unique twitter ID of both the author and the tweet. \n\nNotably, any information related to engagement metrics, i.e. likes, comments, replies, and retweets, is not part of the dataset. This required us to direct our analytical focus towards natural language processing due to the data’s qualitative nature.\n\n**The cleaned data consisted of the following fields:**\n\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid black; width: 70%; margin-left: 40px; text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse;\">\n  <tr>\n    <th style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;\">Variable</th>\n    <th style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;\">Description</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;\">Text</td>\n    <td style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;\">Content of the tweet</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;\">Entities</td>\n    <td style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;\">Various entities mentioned in the tweet, such as hashtags and annotations</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;\">Time</td>\n    <td style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;\">The time the tweet was posted</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;\">Other</td>\n    <td style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;\">Other information, e.g. unique tweet ID, author ID, and edit history were not utilized in this analysis</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nWe began our analysis by exploring the dataset to understand the dataset on a broad level before diving into an analysis. We began by creating a word cloud of the tweet textual data. \n\n<figure style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"wordcloud.png\" alt=\"Word Cloud\" width=\"500\">\n  <figcaption>Fig 1. Word Cloud</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nOlympics, gymnastics, and Simone Biles are all central to this word cloud, indicating a high volume of tweets that contained these words. Other recurrent terms such as \"tokyo2020,\" \"team,\" \"gold,\" and \"sport\" further characterize the dataset’s focus around gymnastics and the Olympic Competition.\n\nWe then looked at the number of tweets per hour and how they evolved over time after Simone Biles made the announcement to drop out of the Olympics. The team used an eight-hour rolling mean to smooth out the curve over a longer time period while still retaining the shape of the data. \n\n<figure style=\"margin-right: 30px; text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"tweetvolume.png\" alt=\"Graph showing the number of tweets over time, with a spike when Biles announces her drop out.\" width=\"600\">\n  <figcaption>Fig 2. Tweet volume per 8 hours.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe see a clear spike right after her announcement, indicating a public response on the day she decided to drop out; however, we also see the number of tweets decrease relatively quickly after August 27, returning to what seems to be normal olympic tweet volume after about a week, and then to low tweet activity after just 2 weeks. This suggests there was not a sustained public reaction.\n\nFinally, we looked at the top 10 most common hashtags present.\n\n<figure style=\"margin-right: 30px; text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"hashtags.png\" alt=\"Bar chart showing top 10 hashtags.\" width=\"700\">\n  <figcaption>Fig 3. Bar Chart of Hashtags.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe can see again an strong focus on gymnastics, with the olympics, and Simone Biles also being important hashtags. We see the first mention of mental health in the 9th most common hashtag, indicating that it is a relevant topic to this dataset, but appears not to be the primary focus of the tweets. With a better understanding of the content of the data, we move on to natural language processing.\n\n### Natural Language Processing\n\n#### Preprocessing\n\nTo prepare for NLP, we further preprocessed the tweet data to standardize it, focusing on the pure textual content. We followed preprocessing protocol by first removing all punctuation and special characters, as well as any stop words like \"the,\" \"is,\" and \"and\" which don't carry meaningful information. Tweets were then lemmatized, breaking down words to their root form (e.g. 'flipping' $\\rightarrow$ 'flip'), which typically improves NLP results. We did our best to remove junk tweets, and decided to remove all links and url patterns from the text as well, to focus on the textual content of each tweet.\n\n#### Sentiment Analysis\n\nFor sentiment analysis, we employed the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) tool, which is well-suited for social media text due to its consideration of contextual polarity and intensity. VADER assigns each tweet a sentiment score based on a predefined lexicon. The sentiment score ranges from -1 to 1, where:\n\n- **Negative sentiment**: Scores closer to -1 indicate negative sentiment.\n- **Neutral sentiment**: Scores around 0 indicate neutral sentiment.\n- **Positive sentiment**: Scores closer to 1 indicate positive sentiment.\n\nEach tweet in the dataset was processed through the VADER tool to generate sentiment scores. The distribution of sentiment scores across the dataset was analyzed and the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral tweets, was calculated. Further analysis was conducted to compare sentiment scores from tweets that came from before and after Biles' announcement, and isolating tweets that specifically discuss mental health to identify different sentiment patterns.\n\nThe sentiment analysis results set the foundation for further investigation into the public's perception of athletes' mental health and provided a contextual basis for the subsequent topic modeling.\n\n#### Non-negative Matrix Factorization\n\nTo further understand the themes and discussions within tweets about Simone Biles, we employed topic modeling, a technique designed to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. This study utilized Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), a method that is particularly effective for high-dimensional text data, providing clearer and more interpretable topics. \n\nWhile many topic modelling techniques were initially tested, like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), NMF was chosen for its robustness in handling large text datasets and its ability to produce easily interpretable topics. NMF works by factorizing the term-document matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices: a term-topic matrix and a topic-document matrix. Each document (tweet) is represented as a mixture of topics, and each topic is represented as a mixture of terms.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n- **Library**: The NMF model was implemented using Python's Scikit-learn library.\n- **Parameter Selection**: The number of topics was determined by evaluating the coherence scores and conducting manual inspections to ensure meaningful and distinct topics.\n- **Process**: The preprocessed tweet data was vectorized using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to create the term-document matrix. This matrix was then decomposed using NMF.\n\nThe resulting topics were analyzed and labeled based on the most representative terms and example tweets for each topic. Each topic was defined by a set of high-weighted words, providing insights into the key themes discussed in relation to Simone Biles' mental health.\n\n## Results\n\nThe sentiment analysis revealed insightful trends in the public's reaction to Simone Biles' mental health disclosure. A histogram plot of the sentiment scores distribution for all tweets in the dataset indicated that the majority of sentiment scores were close to neutral, with a slight skew towards positive sentiments. This suggests that, overall, the public sentiment towards Simone Biles during this period was more supportive than critical. This surprised the team, as we expected a significant negative sentiment to be present.\n\n<figure style=\"margin-right: 30px; text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"Sentiment.png\" alt=\"Histogram showing distribution of tweets' sentiment scores.\" width=\"700\">\n  <figcaption>Fig 4. Histogram distribution of sentiment scores for tweets.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFurther analysis was conducted to compare sentiment scores before and after Biles' announcement. Histogram plots for each period visually appeared similar, implying no significant change in sentiment of tweets before and after Biles announced her withdrawal. The average sentiment score before her withdrawal was 0.172, and after was 0.174. A t-test confirmed no statistically significant difference between the means, indicating that Biles' announcement did not drastically alter public sentiment.\n\n* insert figure *\n\nAnother split on the dataset was conducted to examine whether tweets specifically discussing mental health exhibited different sentiment patterns, which was done by isolating tweets containing mental health awareness keywords and hashtags. The sentiment distribution of these tweets, compared to those without such keywords, showed that mental health-related tweets had slightly more extreme positive sentiment scores. The average sentiment for mental health tweets was 0.173, while for non-mental health tweets, it was 0.163. However, a t-test found no significant difference between these means, suggesting that the overall sentiment towards mental health topics in the context of Biles' situation remained consistent with the general sentiment.\n\n* insert figure *\n\nThe topic modeling analysis using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) identified several key themes within the tweets. Prominent topics included support and encouragement for Simone Biles, discussions about mental health awareness, and debates on the pressures faced by athletes. Each topic was characterized by a set of high-weighted words and representative tweets, providing a nuanced understanding of the public discourse.\n\nFor instance, one of the main topics revolved around the support Biles received from fans and fellow athletes, highlighted by terms such as \"brave,\" \"inspirational,\" and \"support.\" Another significant topic focused on the broader conversation about mental health in sports, with terms like \"mental health,\" \"awareness,\" and \"importance\" featuring prominently.\n\n<style>\n  .centered-table {\n    width: 50%;\n    margin-left: 20px; /* Adjust this value for tab-indenting */\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n  .centered-table table {\n    width: 100%;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n  .centered-table th, .centered-table td {\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    padding: 5px;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"centered-table\">\n| Topic | Associated Words |\n| ---   |  ---   |\n|  1    | olympics, watching, beam |\n|  2    | misogyoir, racism, sexism |\n|  3    | simonebiles, mental, health |\n|  4    | suni lee, bars, amazing |\n|  5    | rapinoe, zanetti, mamute |\n</div>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# Create the data frame\ndf <- data.frame(\n  Topic = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n  Associated_Words = c(\"olympics, watching, beam\", \n                       \"misogyoir, racism, sexism\", \n                       \"simonebiles, mental, health\", \n                       \"suni lee, bars, amazing\", \n                       \"rapinoe, zanetti, mamute\")\n)\n\n# Render the table with kable and kableExtra\nkable(df, format = \"html\") %>%\n  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = \"left\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; \">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Topic </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Associated_Words </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> olympics, watching, beam </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> misogyoir, racism, sexism </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> simonebiles, mental, health </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> suni lee, bars, amazing </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> rapinoe, zanetti, mamute </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nTo prepare the data for analysis we first extracted the entities from each tweet to store them individually to make analysis easier. Many features of the dataset were not utilized in this analysis - for example, columns relating to\nunique tweet and author ID numbers, IDs of referenced tweets, information about any withheld content, and the edit history of tweets.\n\n\nUtilizing TextBlob, a python sentiment library, we were able to assign a sentiment score to each tweet, acting as an estimate of the overall positive or negative attitude. This is achieved with a word lexicon that assigns a score to most english words, and those scores are averaged to give an estimate of the overall sentiment of a tweet. With this we were able to give every tweet a sentiment score and analyze the changes and patterns in sentiments over time and within different groups.\n\nNMF:\n**Understanding the Output:**\n- **Top Words**: The top words for each topic were examined to understand the main themes.\n- **Example Tweets**: Representative tweets were reviewed to provide context and validate the relevance of the topics.\n- **Topic Distribution**: The prevalence of each topic across the dataset was analyzed to identify dominant themes and trends over time.\n",
